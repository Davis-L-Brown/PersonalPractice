MVVM Architetural Patter
MVVM -> Model View ViewModel
Consists of three moving parts
	1. Model - business objects that encapsulate the data and behaviour of application domain
	2. View - what the user sees
	3. ViewModel - model designed for the view. A class with properties that represent the state of the view
					and methods that implement the logic behind the view
	EG a page with a list and a button
		--------------------
		|	Add				|		When the user clicks a button an item is added to the list
		|					|
		| Item1				|
		| Item2				|
		| ...				|
		---------------------

		To create a view model for this view we need a class with:
			a property like items.
				Items - an observable collection: represents the state of the view
			a method like Add()
				Add() - called when we click the btnAdd
